# IEnumerable, ISaveable, IDontGetIt: Understanding .NET Interfaces
We all want code that is easy to maintain, extend, and test. C# interfaces are here to help. Weâ€™ll take a look at how we can use interfaces effectively in our code, starting at the beginning ("What are interfaces?") and then exploring why we want to use them. Along the way we'll use existing interfaces, implement own interfaces, and take a look at dynamic loading, unit testing, and dependency injection. All of which is made easier with interfaces.

Code samples and slides are included in this repository.
